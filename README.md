# Analysis of Wage Determinants Across European Countries

This project is part of a university course in statistics and focuses on modeling the average wage levels in European countries based on selected explanatory variables using linear regression techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Project Goals

1. **Descriptive Analysis of Wages:**  
   - Numerical and graphical summary of average wages.  
   - Discussion of possible influencing factors.

2. **Selection and Exploration of Regressors:**  
   - Collection of four relevant country-level indicators from Eurostat or other sources.  
   - At least one numeric and one categorical variable (e.g., sea access, Euro currency, monarchy vs. republic).  
   - Summary statistics and visualizations.  
   - Testing dependencies between regressors.

3. **Regression Modeling:**  
   - Construction and interpretation of a linear regression model.  
   - Model diagnostics: multicollinearity, outliers, and assumption checks.  
   - Use of robust methods if assumptions are violated.  
   - Model refinement to exclude insignificant predictors and improve interpretability.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `car`, `performance`, `lmtest`, `readr`
